Thoughts about friend situation. - Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. **19 **You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that---and shudder.

**5 **"I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. **6 **If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. **7 **If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. **8 **This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
