# Sabbath. 8-20-2016

Thoughts about friend situation. - Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. **19 **You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that---and shudder.

**5 **"I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. **6 **If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. **7 **If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. **8 **This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.

## You fall in love with what you focus on.

## See how little you can get by on instead of how much you can get away with

## God first God alone.

## Romans 8\. Spirit is what God wants. Flesh is what you want.

## "Enjoyment is the seal of eternity."

Message from last week. Because it shows satisfaction. Joy is a sign of a life connected to God. Content with what He provides. Is your family better ? Can I show more enjoyment? We are being taken care of.

Tim Purdys - never once wanted a message replayed in another church.

Used to read Ecclesiastes... "What is the point?". I go to the store , pick up stuff, do it over and over again. What is the point. ?

Terrel - read the Bible 6 times and Gwen will read something and I'll say, where is that in the Bible ? Gwen has a gift of getting the truth in our hearts.

**Kate Tran. Gwen prayed. His Will on earth as it is in Heaven.**

### Rusty. **10 **When the Lord your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you---a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, **11 **houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant---then when you eat and are satisfied, **12 **be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
