Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. **19 **You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that---and shudder.

**5 **"I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. **6 **If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. **7 **If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. **8 **This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.

Romans 8\. Spirit is what God wants. Flesh is what you want. 

"Enjoyment is the seal of eternity." Message from last week. Because it shows satisfaction. Joy is a sign of a life connected to God. Content with what He provides. Is your family better ? Can I show more enjoyment? We are being taken care of.
