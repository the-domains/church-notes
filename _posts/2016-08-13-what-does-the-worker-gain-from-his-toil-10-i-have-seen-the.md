  What does the worker gain from his toil? 10 I have seen the burden God has
  laid on men.11 He has made everything beautiful in its time.He has also set
  eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from
  beginning to end. 12 I know that there is nothing better for men than to be
  happy and do good while they live. 13

# That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil---this is the gift of God. .

Meaningless... repetitive. ... ,,,

Eternal life vs earthly life.

## **34 **I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. **35 **Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."

It's not about the work.

Nothing on earth bring you satisfaction. Doing God's will is what brings joy, enjoyment.
